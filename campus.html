<div style="border: 1px solid orangered;" class="infos"><p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 3px;padding: 5px;"> Welcome to the sports of JSS Academy of Technical Education! We are very proud to be a part of an institute which has carved a niche in various sports activities. The sports office is housed in the multipurpose hall built at a cost of Rs. 1.5 crores. It provides indoor and outdoor sports facilities for 4000 students. We firmly believe that sports not only provides entertainment but also helps embedding students with life skills which would help them throughout their lives. Sports today cannot be seen just as a form of physical activity but an engagement which helps in adding value and building character in students. The gardeners and housekeeping staff help in maintaining the games and sports facility. In fact, sports offer wide ranging benefits and should be encouraged fully in view of the following:
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle; font-size: 22px;margin: 2px; padding: 8px;">
    <li>Sports help to inculcate values such as dedication, discipline and responsibility in students. Most sports require that the person playing it be athletic or at least be fit. Sports offers more fun in the process of keeping fit. While one can keep fit by going to the gym.</li>
